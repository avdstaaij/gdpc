    :title: Deprecated

    **This entire module is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.**

    There are multiple reasons for this:
        - It is incompatible with our `plans <https://github.com/avdstaaij/gdpc/issues/99>`_
          to make GDPC Minecraft-version-independent.
        - It simply requires too much maintenance; the block categories are entirely manual, so
          they had to be manually updated for each Minecraft version (which was also error-prone).

    We apologize for the inconvenience. A partial alternative to this module is the excellent and
    well-maintained `minecraft-data
    <https://github.com/PrismarineJS/minecraft-data>`_ repository. It provides a complete listing of
    all blocks for nearly all Minecraft versions, including various properties. (There is also a
    `python wrapper <https://github.com/SpockBotMC/python-minecraft-data>`_ for it, but it's
    outdated.) Furthermore, there is work within the GDMC community to create an even more complete
    dataset that categorizes blocks by their `block tags <https://minecraft.wiki/w/Block_tags>`_,
    which is more automatable and thus much easier to maintain.
    Finally, you could also simply copy any constants that you find useful out of GDPC and into your
    own code.

    If you want to help the GDMC community by maintaining this module as another python package, you
    are welcome to do so!

.. warning::
    The block ID categories in this file may not be fully up-to-date with the latest supported
    Minecraft version. Since the file is deprecated, they won't be updated in the future either.
