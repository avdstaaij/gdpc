## Vectors in GDPC

Many functions in GDPC deal with positions or directions in 2D or 3D space,
either as parameters or as return values. Rather than using separate X, Y and Z
numbers for these purposes, GDPC uses *vectors*: single objects that describe
a 2D or 3D point.

### Vectors as parameters

An example of a function with a vector parameter is `Editor.placeBlock()`.
Its first parameter, `position`, should be set to a single object that
represents a 3D vector. For example, the call below places a block at
`X=0`, `Y=80`, `Z=0`:

```python
editor.placeBlock((0,80,0), Block("stone"))
```

GDPC accepts any object that "behaves" like a vector as arguments to its
functions. This means that the following calls all work:

```python
editor.placeBlock((0,80,0),           Block("stone"))
editor.placeBlock([0,80,0],           Block("stone"))
editor.placeBlock(np.array([0,80,0]), Block("stone"))
```

GDPC refers to objects that "behave" like a vector as *vector-likes*. Depending
on the function, a different kind of vector-like may be needed.
The required type of vector-likes for vector parameters is documented via type
hints, which you can view in the [API reference](../api/index). There are
currently four types:

- {class}`.Vec2iLike` - A vector-like of two integers.

- {class}`.Vec3iLike` - A vector-like of three integers.

- {class}`.Vec2bLike` - A vector-like of two booleans

- {class}`.Vec3bLike` - A vector-like of three booleans.

The exact requirements for an object `vec` to be considered a vector-like are
as follows:

- Its elements must be accessible via indexing: {python}`y = vec[1]`.
- Its elements must be accessible via iteration: {python}`for component in vec:`
- Its length must be gettable: {python}`length = len(vec)`.
- It must have the correct length (depends on the type).
- Its elements must have the correct type (depends on the type).

If you pass a vector-like with elements of the wrong type, such as a vector of
floats where is vector of integers is needed, the elements will be converted to
the correct type. Passing a vector of the wrong length usually results in an
exception.

```{note}
The motivation behind the vector-like system in GDPC, is that it allows you to
make use of specialized vector classes (such as those from
[numpy](https://numpy.org/),
[pygame](https://www.pygame.org) or
[pyGLM](https://pypi.org/project/PyGLM/)
),
while imposing as few requirements as possible, and still allowing you to pass
separate `x`/`y`/`z` numbers with just slightly more syntax.
Many libraries define their own vector types, but GDPC allows you to use
whichever you like.
```

### Vectors as return values

When a GDPC function returns a vector, it always returns a vector class from the
[pyGLM](https://pypi.org/project/PyGLM/) package.
These vectors support vector math operators, which can often simplify code, and
have handy `.x`, `.y` and `.z` attributes. PyGLM also provides many performant
vector math functions. Refer to the
[pyGLM documentation](https://pypi.org/project/PyGLM/) for more details.
Here is a small example of the syntax:

```python
from pyglm.glm import ivec3

v1 = ivec3(1,2,3)
v2 = ivec3(1,0,1)

print(v1.x) # 1

sum_v = v1 + v2
print(sum_v) # ivec3(2,2,4)

scaled_v = 2 * v1
print(scaled_v) # ivec3(2,4,6)
```

The pyGLM vectors fulfill the requirements to be vector-likes, so you can
pass them right back to GDPC.

If you prefer to work with separate `x`, `y` and `z` variables, you can always
"unpack" any returned pyGLM vectors:

```python
vec = ivec3(1,2,3)
x, y, z = vec
```

You can also convert pyGLM vectors to tuples with `tuple()`. This can be useful
if you want to index a numpy array with a pyGLM vector or if you want a cleaner
`print()` output.

```python
vec = ivec3(1,2,3)

array = np.zeros((5,5,5))
array[tuple(vec)] = 1 # Set array[1,2,3] to 1.

print(tuple(vec)) # (1,2,3)
```


## Vector tools

GDPC provides various vector utilities in the {mod}`.vector_tools` module.
Like all GDPC functions, you can call them with any vector-like type, though
they will always return pyGLM vectors.

There are four categories of vector utilities:
*constants*, *general vector utilities*, *the Rect and Box classes*, and
*shape-generating functions*. We will summarize and give some examples for each
category.

### Constants

The {mod}`.vector_tools` module contains various vector constants
(all pyGLM vectors) that may simplify computations. For example:

```python
from pyglm.glm import ivec3
from gdpc.vector_tools import SOUTH, Y, XZ

pos = ivec3(0,0,0)
pos = pos + 1 * SOUTH + 2 * Y + 3 * XZ
print(pos) # ivec3(3,2,4)
```

### General utilities

The {mod}`.vector_tools` module contains lots of general vector manipulation
utilities. For example:

```python
from pyglm.glm import ivec2, ivec3
from gdpc.vector_tools import addY, dropY, perpendicular, toAxisVector2D

# addY() turns a 2D vector into a 3D one by adding a Y component.
vec = ivec2(1,3)
vec = addY(vec, 2)
print(vec) # ivec3(1,2,3)

# dropY() does the reverse.
vec = ivec3(4,5,6)
vec = dropY(vec)
print(vec) # ivec2(4,6)

# perpendicular() returns a vector that is perpendicular to the given one.
vec = perpendicular((1,0))
print(vec) # ivec2(0,-1)

# toAxisVector2D() returns the axis-aligned vector closest to the given one.
vec = toAxisVector2D((11,2))
print(vec) # ivec2(1,0)
```

### Rect and Box

The {mod}`.vector_tools` module contains the {class}`.Rect` and {class}`.Box`
classes.
A `Rect` represents a 2D rectangle, defined by and offset and a size (both 2D
vectors), and a `Box` is the analogue in 3D. There are several GDPC functions
that take a `Rect` or `Box` as parameter or return one.

Here is an example that shows some of `Rect`'s features (`Box` works the same):

```python
from gdpc.vector_tools import Rect

rect = Rect((1,2), (5,5)) # offset = (1,2), size = (5,5)

print(rect.offset) # ivec2(1,2)
print(rect.size)   # ivec2(5,5)
print(rect.end)    # ivec2(6,7)
print(rect.center) # ivec2(3,4)
print(rect.area)   # 25

print(rect.contains((3,3))) # True

# Loop through all internal points
for vec in rect:
   print(vec) # ivec2(1,2), ivec2(1,3), ..., ivec2(5,6)

# Create a rect with the given corners
rect = Rect.between((1,5), (3,2))
print(rect) # Rect((1,2), (3,4))

# Create a rect containing the given points
rect = Rect.bounding([(1,1), (1,3), (2,2)])
print(rect) # Rect((1,1), (2,3))
```

### Shape-generating functions

Finally, the {mod}`.vector_tools` module contains several functions that
generate the points of a geometric shape. For example:

```python
from gdpc.vector_tools import loop3D, line3D, circle

# loop3D() loops over a 3D box defined by a begin and an end.
# It's essentially a 3D variant of python's built-in range() function.
for vec in loop3D((1,2,3), (5,5,5)):
   print(vec) # ivec3(1,2,3), ivec3(1,2,4), ivec3(1,3,3), ..., ivec3(4,4,4)

# line3D generates the points of a 3D line defined by two endpoints (inclusive).
for vec in line3D((1,2,3), (5,5,5)):
   print(vec) # ivec3(1,2,3), ivec3(2,3,4), ivec3(3,4,4), ivec3(4,4,4), ivec3(5,5,5)

# circle() generates the points of a 2D circle defined by a center and diameter.
for vec in circle((5,5), 5):
   print(vec) # ivec2(7,4), ivec2(7,5), ivec2(7,6), ivec2(6,7), ...
```

## Minecraft's coordinate system

When working with vectors in the context of a Minecraft world, you should be
aware that Minecraft's coordinate system has some unusual properties:

1. Minecraft's coordinate system is right-handed with Y pointing up.
   This means that, when facing towards the positive Z direction, the positive X
   direction points to the *left*, not to the right. If you use GDPC to build a
   structure while assuming that Z points forward and X points to the right,
   this may cause the structure to be a mirrored version of what you intended.

2. Minecraft performs rotations in what is normally considered the *left-handed*
   way, even though its coordinate system is right-handed. That is, things like
   sign rotations or the command `/execute rotated` rotate from positive X
   towards positive Z. All GDPC functions that perform some kind of rotation,
   such as {func}`.rotate3D`, follow Minecraft's convention.
