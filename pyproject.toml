    # Reason for ignoring:
    # DI: Disagree         - I disagree with this rule in nearly all cases.
    # AL: Alternative      - The rule is incompatible with an alternative rule.
    # TB: Too broad        - The rule is sometimes useful, but gives too many false positives.
    # PA: Public API       - The fix may require changing a public API, making this rule unusable in many cases.
    # HI: Hint             - The rule would be useful at hint-severity, if ruff supported that.
    # PR: Project-specific - There is a project-specific reason to not use this rule.

    # Mainly DI
    "RUF010",  # explicit-f-string-type-conversion - DI - Explicit conversion is more readable. See also https://peps.python.org/pep-0498/#s-r-and-a-are-redundant

    # Mainly AL
    "D203",    # incorrect-blank-line-before-class - AL - Disabled in favor of D211.
    "D213",    # multi-line-summary-second-line - AL - Disabled in favor of D212.

    # Mainly TB
    "ANN401",  # any-type - TB - Any can be useful for very generic interfaces or as an acceptable temporary solution.
    "B007",    # unused-loop-control-variable - TB - The loop variable may be used after the loop; it might count something. Redundant with F841.
    "C90",     # mccabe - TB - May be hard to fix, and real issues can be spotted manually.
    "D1",      # undocumented-* - TB - Documenting everything is not necessary in scripts.
    "D105",    # undocumented-magic-method - TB - Many magic methods are self-explanatory.
    "D202",    # blank-line-after-function - TB - Adding a blank line can improve readability when the docstring is short.
    "D204",    # incorrect-blank-line-after-class - TB - The blank line can be unnecessary for very short classes.
    "D205",    # missing-blank-line-after-summary - TB - A single line is sometimes too limiting, and most tools can handle multiple lines.
    "D209",    # new-line-after-last-paragraph - TB - It's a bit nasty, but breaking this rule can help compactify short docstrings.
    "D301",    # escape-sequence-in-docstring - TB - It's a bit nasty, but breaking this rule with "\n" can help compactify short docstrings.
    "D400",    # missing-trailing-period - TB - Other punctuation is also acceptable. We use D415 instead.
    "D401",    # non-imperative-mood - TB - This is very controversial. I personally prefer the descriptive mood in most cases.
    "D404",    # docstring-starts-with-this - TB - There are valid usages of "this", such as when referring to a method's object.
    "E501",    # line-too-long - TB - Lines occasionally need to be longer, such as when a comment contains a long link.
    "E701",    # multiple-statements - TB - Single-line if-statements can be more readable in certain scenarios.
    "E741",    # ambiguous-variable-name - TB - "l" is often fine, and the others may occasionally be fine as well.
    "ERA001",  # commented-out-code - TB - Commenting out code is sometimes useful, and this also triggers on intentional code examples.
    "FBT001",  # boolean-type-hint-positional-argument - TB, PA - Mostly redundant with FBT003.
    "FBT002",  # boolean-default-value-positional-argument - TB, PA - Mostly redundant with FBT003.
    "INP001",  # implicit-namespace-package - TB - The namespace package may be intentional. Also triggers on Sphinx' conf.py.
    "ISC003",  # explicit-string-concatenation - TB - In cases where some lines are literals and some expressions, it is clearer to use + everywhere.
    "PERF203", # try-except-in-loop - TB - The try-except can often not be taken out of the loop.
    "PLR091",  # too-many-* - TB, PA - Real issues can be spotted manually.
    "PLR2004", # magic-value-comparison - TB - Although this rule is often right, there are also many cases where a constant is overkill.
    "PLW2901", # redefined-loop-name - TB - Reuse of the loop variable can help keep names simple. This rule does have a strong case, though.
    "PTH",     # flake8-use-pathlib - TB, HI - Old-style path manipulation is acceptable, and occasionally even more readable.
    "S311",    # suspicious-non-cryptographic-random-usage - TB - Not all random usages are cryptographic.

    # Mainly HI
    "FIX",     # flake8-fixme - HI
    "TD",      # flake8-todos - HI

    # Mainly PR
    "N802",    # invalid-function-name - PR, PA - For historical reasons, GDPC uses camelCase.
    "N803",    # invalid-argument-name - PR, PA - for historical reasons, GDPC uses camelCase.
    "N806",    # non-lowercase-variable-in-function - PR - For historical reasons, GDPC uses camelCase.
    "N815",    # mixed-case-variable-in-class-scope - PR, PA - For historical reasons, GDPC uses camelCase.
    "N816",    # mixed-case-variable-in-global-scope - PR, PA - For historical reasons, GDPC uses camelCase.
    "PGH003",  # blanket-type-ignore - PR - GDPC uses blanket type ignores for pyright-strict-mode unknown-type errors when accessing NBT data.
